    <p>The A110 achieved most of its fame in the early 1970s as a successful rally car. After winning several rallies in France in the late 1960s with the cast-iron R8 Gordini Cléon-Fonte engines the car was fitted with the aluminium-block Cléon-Alu from the Renault 16 TS.</p>

    <p>The A110 was originally offered with 1.1 L R8 Major or R8 Gordini engines. The Gordini engine has a power output of 95 PS SAE (70 kW) at 6,500 rpm. Unlike most European manufacturers, Alpine stuck to the providing the more impressive seeming SAE power figures until well into the 1970s.</p>
