   <h3>2.BENTLEY</h3>
   <p>Bentley 3½ Litre Sports, year 1934. Colour two tone pale green/dark green with a cognac leather interior and matching carpet. This ‘Derby’ Bentley left the factory with an open tourer bodywork on 3 August 1934. The automobile was shipped to the first owner in South Africa. In the 1940ies the Bentley was shipped back to the UK. In the late 1980ies, early 1990ies the automobile was given the current gorgeous two-seater sports bodywork inspired on the Derby Bentley owned by racing legend Eddie Hall. From this period a vast amount of restoration invoices is in file. The car was sold to the Netherlands, and in the period 2017-2018 the Bentley was taken apart again, given perfect new paint, and the car meticulously built-up again. This Bentley 3½ Litre Sports is excellent condition and the automobile drives majestic! The engine runs smooth and powerful, the gearbox shifts perfectly, and the ride is ‘prewar’ sporty yet comfortable. This Bentley features an easy to erect mohair hood, side screens and a tonneau cover to complete the weather equipment. Behind the seats a third seat is hidden below the top deck. The deck can be removed and placed back as a back rest, a very clever find! This is a highly desirable and unique Bentley in excellent condition!</p>

    <p>The Bentley 3.5 Litre was presented to the public in September 1933. The Bentley 3.5 Litre was the first new Bentley model since Rolls Royce took over the company in 1931. These Bentley models are also known as "Derby Bentley's" this because they were built in the Rolls Royce factory located in Derby, England.
        The Bentley 3.5 Litre was the result of the Rolls Royce project "Peregrine" which was aimed at developing an automobile on a shorter chassis. The car was projected below the Rolls Royce 20/25 en the Rolls Royce Phantom. The Bentley 3.5 Litre was going to be a competitor for the Alvis Speed 20 and the Lagonda M45.
        
        The Bentley 3.5 Litre was available from the factory as rolling chassis or with several standard bodywork variant. The factory bodywork models were made by Park Ward and the model program consisted of a saloon, a streamline saloon and a drophead coupe.
        The rolling chassis which left the factory were "dressed" by other well known coachwork builders like H.J. Mulliner, Trupp & Maberly, James Young, H.R. Owen, Gurney Nutting, William Arnold, Kellner (Paris) and the Swiss coachwork builder Graber.
        The steel chassis was produced using nickel steel. The chassis was designed with a "double-dropped" layout to gain vertical space for the axles and to keep the cars profile low. The chassis was constructed with six cross members and no diagonal cross bracing. The strong chassis was very light in comparison to the chassis built by the contemporary competitors.
        The Bentley 3.5 Litre six cylinder in-line engine was a further development of the Rolls Royce 20/25 engine. The 3.5 Litre however was far more powerful... The engine was given a larger cylinder capacity, higher compression, a sharper (sporty) camshaft profile and two S.U. carburettors.
        
        Because of the high power potential of the new 3.5 litre engine some standard high quality Rolls Royce parts were considered inferior by the engineers. They stated that the critical parts had to be of ultimate quality for use in this engine...
        Building a sportive Bentley with a lower price tag than a Rolls Royce became more and more an impossible goal to aim for.
        Engineer in charge of the project, Mr. Hives, wrote in a memo addressed to the staff of the company; "Our recommendation is that we should make the car as good as we know how and then charge accordingly".
        No need to say more...

   <h4>3.FERRARI F40</h4>
   <p>The Ferrari F40 (Type F120) is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car engineered by Nicola Materazzi with styling by Pininfarina. It was built from 1987 until 1992, with the LM and GTE race car versions continuing production until 1994 and 1996 respectively. As the successor to the 288 GTO (also engineered by Materazzi), it was designed to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary and was the last Ferrari automobile personally approved by Enzo Ferrari. At the time it was Ferrari's fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car for sale.

    The car debuted with a planned production total of four hundred units and a factory suggested retail price of approximately US$400,000 (fivefold the price of its predecessor, the 288 GTO) in 1987 ($1,070,000 today). One of those that belonged to the Formula One driver Nigel Mansell was sold for the then record of £1 million in 1990, a record that stood into the 2010s. A total of 1,311 to 1,315 cars were manufactured with 213 units destined for the United States.</p>

    <p>The car saw competition as early as 1989 when it debuted in the Laguna Seca Raceway round of the IMSA, appearing in the GTO category, with an LM evolution model driven by Jean Alesi, finishing third to the two faster spaceframe four wheel drive Audi 90s and beating a host of other factory-backed spaceframe specials that dominated the races. In the following race, it had to retire after eighteen laps. The next IMSA season, driven by a host of guest drivers such as Jean-Pierre Jabouille, Jacques Laffite and Hurley Haywood, three second-places and one third-place were the best results.

        Although the F40 would not return to IMSA in 1991, it would later be a popular choice by privateers to compete in numerous domestic GT series including JGTC.
        
        In 1994, the car made its debut in international competitions, with one car campaigned in the BPR Global GT Series by Strandell, winning at the 4 Hours of Vallelunga.
        
        In 1995, the number of F40s climbed to four, developed independently by Pilot-Aldix Racing (F40 LM) and Strandell (F40 GTE, racing under the Ferrari Club Italia banner), winning the 4 Hours of Anderstorp. No longer competitive against the newly entered McLaren F1 GTR, the Ferrari F40 returned for another year in 1996, managing to repeat the previous year's Anderstorp win, and from then on it was no longer seen in GT racing.
        
        In total nineteen cars were produced.</p>
