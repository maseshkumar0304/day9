   <h3>2.BENTLEY</h3>
   <p>Bentley 3½ Litre Sports, year 1934. Colour two tone pale green/dark green with a cognac leather interior and matching carpet. This ‘Derby’ Bentley left the factory with an open tourer bodywork on 3 August 1934. The automobile was shipped to the first owner in South Africa. In the 1940ies the Bentley was shipped back to the UK. In the late 1980ies, early 1990ies the automobile was given the current gorgeous two-seater sports bodywork inspired on the Derby Bentley owned by racing legend Eddie Hall. From this period a vast amount of restoration invoices is in file. The car was sold to the Netherlands, and in the period 2017-2018 the Bentley was taken apart again, given perfect new paint, and the car meticulously built-up again. This Bentley 3½ Litre Sports is excellent condition and the automobile drives majestic! The engine runs smooth and powerful, the gearbox shifts perfectly, and the ride is ‘prewar’ sporty yet comfortable. This Bentley features an easy to erect mohair hood, side screens and a tonneau cover to complete the weather equipment. Behind the seats a third seat is hidden below the top deck. The deck can be removed and placed back as a back rest, a very clever find! This is a highly desirable and unique Bentley in excellent condition!</p>

   <p>The Bentley 3.5 Litre was presented to the public in September 1933. The Bentley 3.5 Litre was the first new Bentley model since Rolls Royce took over the company in 1931. These Bentley models are also known as "Derby Bentley's" this because they were built in the Rolls Royce factory located in Derby, England.
    The Bentley 3.5 Litre was the result of the Rolls Royce project "Peregrine" which was aimed at developing an automobile on a shorter chassis. The car was projected below the Rolls Royce 20/25 en the Rolls Royce Phantom. The Bentley 3.5 Litre was going to be a competitor for the Alvis Speed 20 and the Lagonda M45.
    
    The Bentley 3.5 Litre was available from the factory as rolling chassis or with several standard bodywork variant. The factory bodywork models were made by Park Ward and the model program consisted of a saloon, a streamline saloon and a drophead coupe.
    The rolling chassis which left the factory were "dressed" by other well known coachwork builders like H.J. Mulliner, Trupp & Maberly, James Young, H.R. Owen, Gurney Nutting, William Arnold, Kellner (Paris) and the Swiss coachwork builder Graber.
    The steel chassis was produced using nickel steel. The chassis was designed with a "double-dropped" layout to gain vertical space for the axles and to keep the cars profile low. The chassis was constructed with six cross members and no diagonal cross bracing. The strong chassis was very light in comparison to the chassis built by the contemporary competitors.
    The Bentley 3.5 Litre six cylinder in-line engine was a further development of the Rolls Royce 20/25 engine. The 3.5 Litre however was far more powerful... The engine was given a larger cylinder capacity, higher compression, a sharper (sporty) camshaft profile and two S.U. carburettors.
    
    Because of the high power potential of the new 3.5 litre engine some standard high quality Rolls Royce parts were considered inferior by the engineers. They stated that the critical parts had to be of ultimate quality for use in this engine...
    Building a sportive Bentley with a lower price tag than a Rolls Royce became more and more an impossible goal to aim for.
    Engineer in charge of the project, Mr. Hives, wrote in a memo addressed to the staff of the company; "Our recommendation is that we should make the car as good as we know how and then charge accordingly".
    No need to say more...
